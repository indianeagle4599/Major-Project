# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media

This repository contains the codes and models used for creation and deployment of a Sentiment Analysis project based on text.

## How does it work

- It uses Natural Language Processing to determine the Sentiment of a given text.
- It was created in Python using libraries which are used in Machine Learning projects.
- The different models saved in the ".sav" format were trained using datasets of more than a million tweets and thousnads of reddit comments.
- The final application can predict the sentiment of a given text as:
  - Positive :)
  - Negative :(
  - Neutral :|
- The files saved on the main page of the repository are used by Heroku to access the models and other relevant code.

#### NOTE
